# Scripts

This is the main directory for storing _ad hoc_ scripts related from analyses related to the project.
Scripts used to run a workflow related to snakemake should be placed inside `workflow/rules/scripts` instead.

By default, this repository is synced to GitHub (controlled via `.gitignore`)

Use this README to describe directory structure and contents.

Some example scripts are provided
